# Matplotlib-challenge
Here are three observations or inferences that can be made from the data and the code provided:

- Data Cleaning and Merging: The code begins by reading two CSV files, "Mouse_metadata.csv" and "Study_results.csv," and then merging them into a single DataFrame called mouse_data_complete. During this process, duplicate rows with the same "Mouse ID" and "Timepoint" are identified and removed to ensure data integrity. The data appears to be cleaned and prepared for analysis.

- Drug Regimen Analysis: The code provides summary statistics for tumor volume based on different drug regimens. It calculates the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM) for each drug regimen. This analysis allows for a comparison of the effectiveness of different drug treatments on tumor volume reduction.

- Outlier Detection: The code identifies potential outliers for the final tumor volume of mice treated with four specific drug regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. It calculates the interquartile range (IQR) for each regimen and defines potential outliers as values below the lower bound or above the upper bound. This information can help in identifying data points that may need further investigation.


**Code Explanation:**
# Mouse Cancer Study Data Analysis

This README provides an overview of the code used to analyze data from a mouse cancer study. The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Data Sources

- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Metadata about the mice used in the study, including information about their ID, age, gender, and weight.
- `Study_results.csv`: Results of the study, including data on tumor volume, metastatic sites, timepoints, and drug regimens.

## Code Overview

The code can be divided into several sections, each performing specific tasks:

1. **Data Preparation**: Reading and cleaning the data by removing duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

2. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics for tumor volume for each drug regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM).

3. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots to visualize the data, including bar plots to show the distribution of timepoints for each drug regimen, pie charts to display the distribution of male and female mice, and box plots to show the distribution of tumor volume for each treatment group.

4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying potential outliers for the final tumor volume of mice treated with specific drug regimens using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

5. **Additional Analysis**: Further analysis includes generating a line plot of tumor volume over time for a specific mouse and calculating the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

6. **Linear Regression**: Creating a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume, including calculating the slope, intercept, R-squared value, p-value, and standard error.

## Usage

You can run the code by executing the provided Python script. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, and the data files (`Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv`) are in the specified paths.

## Results

The code provides valuable insights into the mouse cancer study data, including summary statistics for different drug regimens, data visualizations, outlier detection, and regression analysis. These analyses can aid in understanding the effectiveness of various drug treatments and exploring potential correlations between variables.

Feel free to adjust the code or parameters to perform additional analyses or customize visualizations as needed.
